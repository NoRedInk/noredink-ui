# noredink-ui

UI widgets we use.

## Versioning policy

We try to avoid breaking changes and the associated major version bumps in this package. The reason for that is to avoid the following scenario:

```
  |
  x   4.6.0: Adding RadioButton widget
  |
  x   5.0.0: Breaking change in the TextArea widget
  |
  x   5.0.1: Styling fix in the Checkbox widget
  |
```

Suppose you just released version `5.0.1`, a small styling fix in the checkbox widget, for a story you're working on. If the project you're working in currently pulls in `noredink-ui` at version `4.x`, then getting to your styling fix means pulling in a new major version of `noredink-ui`. This breaks all `TextArea` widgets across the project, so those will need to be fixed before you can do anything else, potentially a big effort.

To prevent these big Yaks from suddenly showing up in seemingly trivial tasks we prefer to avoid breaking changes in the package. Instead when we need to make a breaking change in a widget, we create a new module for it `Nri.Ui.MyWidget.VX`. Similarly, when we build custom elements in JavaScript we create a file `lib/MyWidget/VX.js` and define a custom element `nri-mywidget-vX`.

We should change this process if we feel it's not working for us!

## Examples

This repo contains an app showcasing all of these UI widgets.

To see them locally:

```
make styleguide-app/elm.js
```

Open `styleguide-app/index.html` in your browser.

Alternatively, you may use elm-reactor. Please be aware that you'll need to globally
install fonts (in particular, Muli) if you go this route.

## Tests

Run tests with

```
make test
```

### CI (Travis)

Travis will run `make ci` to verify everything looks good.
You can run this locally to catch errors before you push!
