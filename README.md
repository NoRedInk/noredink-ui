UI widgets we use.

## Examples

This repo contains an app showcasing all of these UI widgets.

To see them locally:

```
> cd styleguide-app
> elm-make Main.elm --output=elm.js
```

Open `index.html` in your browser.

Alternatively, you may use elm-reactor. Please be aware that you'll need to globally
install fonts (in particular, Muli) if you go this route.
